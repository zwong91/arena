# Only Install Arena Binary

Sometimes, we donâ€™t need to install arena completely, we just want to install the arena executable file on our laptop. This document can help you.

1\. Prepare kubeconfig file with name `config` and place it  to `~/.kube`.

2\. Download the latest installer from [Release Page](https://github.com/kubeflow/arena/releases), and rename it to `arena-installer.tar.gz`

3\. execute the following command to untar the package:

```
$ tar -xvf arena-installer.tar.gz
```

4\. copy the executable files to `/usr/local/bin` and rename them:

```
$ chmod +x bin/*
$ cp bin/helm /usr/local/bin/helm
$ cp bin/kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
$ cp bin/arena /usr/local/bin/arena
```

5\. copy the `charts` directory to the home directory of current user.

```
$ cp -a charts ~/
```

Then you can use [tab] to auto complete the command:

```
$ arena list
NAME            STATUS   TRAINER  AGE  NODE
tf1             PENDING  TFJOB    0s   N/A
caffe-1080ti-1  RUNNING  HOROVOD  45s  192.168.1.120

$ arena get [tab]
caffe-1080ti-1  tf1
```
